Would you like me to:

Show you how to implement a sticky navbar that shrinks on scroll?

Add a dark/light mode toggle to the navbar?

Implement dropdown menus for nested navigation items?

Optimize the menu for screen readers and accessibility?

Add a search component to the navbar?

Let me know which enhancement you'd like to tackle next!
